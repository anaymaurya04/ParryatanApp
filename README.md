## Introduction

Parryatan is your ultimate travel companion, providing instant access to relevant information about tourist attractions, monuments, and cultural heritage sites. While solving the problem of preserving and digitizing heritage and monuments in a digital form, it offers a range of handy features. It simplifies the travel experience by offering the following features:

## Features

### 1. QR Code Scanning

Parryatan allows users to scan QR codes placed near monuments and tourist attractions. This functionality instantly provides detailed information about the site, including its history, significance, and other interesting facts.

### 2. Text-to-Speech Functionality

For users who prefer to listen rather than read, Parryatan offers a text-to-speech feature. It reads aloud the information about the monument or attraction, making it accessible to a wider audience, including those with visual impairments.

### 3. Translation

Parryatan caters to a global audience by providing real-time translation services. Users can select their preferred language, and the app will translate the information into their chosen language, breaking down language barriers for travelers.

### 4. Recommendations

The app takes your travel experience to the next level by recommending local delicacies and affordable hotels near the tourist attraction. These recommendations are designed to help you savor local flavors and find a comfortable place to stay without breaking the bank.

## Business Idea

The primary business idea behind Parryatan is to create a platform that caters to the needs of both tourists and local businesses. Here's how Parryatan can generate revenue:

- **Monument Partnerships**: Collaborate with local authorities and monument owners to place QR codes and information about their attractions on the app. Charge a fee for this service, creating a new revenue stream.

- **Advertising**: Partner with local restaurants and hotels to feature their businesses in the recommendation section. These businesses can pay for advertising within the app to attract tourists looking for food and accommodation.

- **Data Analytics**: Collect and analyze user data to provide insights to local businesses about visitor preferences and behaviors, allowing them to tailor their services to better suit the needs of tourists.
